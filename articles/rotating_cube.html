                <h3>Context</h3>
                <p>
                    OpenGL is a popular graphics programming specification that is supported by most GPUs used today. OpenGL
                    is implemented via graphics drivers that are typically written in C and provided by the GPU manufacturer,
                    along with client and API libraries, typically written in assembly, C or C++, the latter of which a
                    programmer can use to interact with the GPU. PyOpenGL is a Python binding to the OpenGL API, which is
                    implemented with Python's ctypes foreign function interface and bridges the gap between Python and the
                    lower-level API library, providing a close replica of the OpenGL API in Python.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This article provides a basic overview of the OpenGL API, before detailing the mathematical
                    transformations required to render a 3D cube in a 2D display. This theory is demonstrated via an
                    implementation of the classic rotating cube exercise in PyOpenGL, without relying on GLM, which is OpenGL's
                    mathematics library. This library abstracts the underlying maths by providing a set of functions for
                    constructing transformation matrices, but we will instead implement these transformations ourselves.
                </p>

                <h3>OpenGL Overview</h3>
                <p>
                    The OpenGL API operates like a state machine which we can interact with in one of two ways: by calling
                    a function which changes the state (e.g., linking a new shader program) or by calling a function which
                    performs an action using the current state (e.g., drawing a shape to the screen). This state is called
                    the OpenGL context and is organised like a C struct, where different sub-components (called objects) can
                    be swapped in and out (called binding and unbinding respectively). 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The transformation of 3D objects in memory to 2D pixels on a screen is performed by OpenGL's graphics
                    pipeline, comprised of a sequence of programs called shaders which run on the GPU and are written
                    in GLSL (the openGL Shading Language). Modern GPUs have hundreds or even thousands of cores, each capable
                    of running a shader in parallel, which is why GPUs are so much faster than CPUs for graphics processing
                    (modern CPUs typically have 4-8 far more generalised cores).
                </p>
                <p>
                    The first stage of the graphics pipeline is the vertex shader, for which there is no default (we must
                    provide our own implementation of this step). This shader receives a single vertex as input, whose 3D
                    coordinates $(x,y,z)$ are in "local space", meaning they are relative to the origin of the object the
                    vertex belongs to. This shader is responsible for converting these local coordinates into 3D homogeneous
                    "clip space" coordinates $(x_C, y_C, z_C, w_C)$, which are then used to determine which parts of objects
                    are visible on the screen. The vertex shader also forwards any other data associated with the vertex
                    for use in later stages of the pipeline (such as 2D texture coordinates). The vertex shader achieves
                    the local to clip space conversion by applying a sequence of transformations:
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            the model transformation converts local coordinates to world coordinates, using information
                            about the object's position, orientation and size in the world we are rendering, and hence
                            is the combination of a scale, translation and rotation transformation;
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            the view transformation converts world coordinates to view/camera coordinates, using information
                            about the position and orientation of the camera in the world, and hence is the combination of a
                            translation and rotation transformation; and
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            the projection transformation converts camera coordinates to clip space coordinates, using
                            information about the camera's type (orthographic or perspective), field of view, aspect ratio
                            and range.
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Following the vertex shader in the graphics pipeline (ignoring some advanced, optional steps) is the primitive
                    assembly stage, where a set of processed vertices are grouped into a sequence of primitives (points, lines or
                    triangles, depending on the context). Next is the clipping stage, where primitives lying outside the viewing
                    volume (defined by $-w_C \le x_C \le w_C$ and likewise for $y_C$ and $z_C$) are discarded, and primitives
                    only partially inside the volume are clipped to fit within it (a triangle may be split into multiple triangles
                    here). Next is the perspective divide
                    $$(x_{\text{NDC}}, y_{\text{NDC}}, z_{\text{NDC}}) \> = \> (\frac{x_C}{w_C}, \frac{y_C}{w_C}, \frac{z_C}{w_C})$$
                    into normalised device coordinates where $|x_{\text{NDC}}| \le 1$, $|y_{\text{NDC}}| \le 1$ and
                    $|z_{\text{NDC}}| \le 1$. After this is the viewport transformation, which converts NDC to window coordinates,
                    which depends on the window size in pixels and the size of the device's depth buffer. Next is face culling,
                    where triangle primitives facing away from view in window space can be discarded, such that they don't need
                    to be rendered. Then the pipeline performs rasterisation, where each primitive is mapped to a set fragments,
                    with at least one fragment per pixel displaying the primitive. A fragment is a collection of all data required
                    to render a single pixel (which includes data that was forwarded from the vertex shader).
                </p>
                <p>
                    The next stage is the fragment shader, which, like the vertex shader, has no default implementation. This shader
                    receives a single fragment as input and returns a colour to be drawn to the screen at its corresponding pixel
                    (as well as some other data including depth). The final stage of the graphics pipeline is a sequence of
                    "per-sample" operations on each fragment, which include pixel ownership testing (which fails if the fragment's
                    pixel location is owned by another overlapping window), depth testing (checking if this fragment is behind
                    another fragment and should be discarded) and blending (combining the fragment's colour with a colour already
                    in the frame buffer for this pixel, to handle opacity).
                </p>

                <h3>Transformation Matrices</h3>
                <p>
                    Before we start programming with PyOpenGL, we first need to define the model, view and projection
                    transformations required to implement our vertex shader. Given a vertex with coordinates $(x,y,z)$, we
                    represent this point in space by the vector of homogeneous coordinates
                    $$\begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \\ z \\ 1 \end{pmatrix},$$
                    where the fourth coordinate will remain 1 until the projection transformation. Given this definition, we can
                    represent a transformation of this point by a 4x4 matrix that is left-multiplied by the vector. An affine
                    transformation such as a scaling, translation or rotation can be achieved with a matrix multiplication of
                    the form
                    $$
                    \begin{pmatrix}
                        m_{11} & m_{12} & m_{13} & 0 \\
                        m_{21} & m_{22} & m_{23} & 0 \\
                        m_{31} & m_{32} & m_{33} & 0 \\
                        0 & 0 & 0 & 1
                    \end{pmatrix}
                    \begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \\ z \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} \> = \>
                    \begin{pmatrix}
                        m_{11} x + m_{12} y + m_{13} z \\
                        m_{21} x + m_{22} y + m_{23} z \\
                        m_{31} x + m_{32} y + m_{33} z \\
                        1
                    \end{pmatrix},
                    $$
                    and hence combining transformations is equivalent to multiplying their representative matrices.
                    The inclusion of the fourth coordinate may seem pointless, but it allows us to represent translation
                    and perspective projection transformations as matrix multiplications, which would not be possible with
                    3x3 matrices.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A scale transformation with scaling factors $s_X, s_Y$ and $s_Z$ converts a point $(x,y,z,1)$ to the
                    point $(s_X x, s_Y y, s_Z z, 1)$, which is achieved by multiplying by the diagonal matrix
                    $$\begin{pmatrix} s_X & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & s_Y & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & s_Z & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix}.$$
                    We can write a Python function which returns this matrix as a 2D NumPy array given a set of scaling factors.

                    A translation transformation which translates by distance $t_X$ in the $x$-direction, $t_Y$ in the
                    $y$-direction and $t_Z$ in the $z$-direction, thus converting a point $(x,y,z,1)$ to the point
                    $(x + t_X, y + t_Y, z + t_Z, 1)$, is achieved by the matrix:

                    This transformation can also be implemented as a simple Python function.

                    A rotation in 3D space is defined by a (unit vector) axis and an angle of rotation about that axis. Any rotation
                    in three dimensions can be achieved by a composition of rotations about the standard basis vectors
                    $$
                        \boldsymbol{i} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}, \>\>
                        \boldsymbol{j} = \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}, \>\>
                        \boldsymbol{k} = \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}.
                    $$
                    Let's focus on a rotation about the $z$-axis / basis vector $\boldsymbol{k}$ by some acute angle $\theta$, and
                    consider how the other two basis vectors $\boldsymbol{i}$ and $\boldsymbol{j}$ are transformed to vectors
                    $\boldsymbol{i}^{\prime}$ and $\boldsymbol{j}^{\prime}$ respectively.
                </p>
                <p>TODO: DIAGRAM LIKE https://austinmorlan.com/posts/rotation_matrices/media/2d_basis_rotated_triangles.png</p>
                <p>
                    We can form a right-angled triangle in the first quadrant of the $xy$-plane with $\boldsymbol{i}^{\prime}$ as
                    the hypotenuse, its $x$-component the adjacent side and its $y$-component the opposite side. The hypotenuse has
                    unit length because a rotation preserves the length of a vector, and the angle at the origin is $\theta$, and
                    hence we the definitions of sine and cosine give
                    $$
                        \cos(\theta) = \frac{\text{adj}}{\text{hyp}} = \frac{i^{\prime}_x}{1}, \>\>
                        \sin(\theta) = \frac{\text{opp}}{\text{hyp}} = \frac{i^{\prime}_y}{1},
                    $$
                    and of course $i^{\prime}_z = 0$ because $i_z = 0$. Forming a similar right-angled triangle between
                    $\boldsymbol{j}^{\prime}$ and its components (noting that $j^{\prime}_x < 0$), we find that
                    $$
                        \cos(\theta) = \frac{j^{\prime}_y}{1}, \>\>
                        \sin(\theta) = \frac{-j^{\prime}_x}{1},
                    $$
                    and $j^{\prime}_z = 0$. Therefore we have that the acute rotation transforms the standard basis vectors to
                    $$
                        \boldsymbol{i}^{\prime} = \begin{pmatrix} \cos(\theta) \\ \sin(\theta) \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}, \>\>
                        \boldsymbol{j}^{\prime} = \begin{pmatrix} -\sin(\theta) \\ \cos(\theta) \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}, \>\>
                        \boldsymbol{k}^{\prime} = \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}.
                    $$
                    It can be shown that these results generalise to a rotation by any angle $\theta$. For an obtuse $\theta$, we
                    can draw the above triangles for the acute angle $180^{\deg}-\theta$ between the rotated basis vector and the
                    $x$ and $y$ axes, then using the fact that $\cos(180^{\deg}-\theta) = -\cos(\theta)$ and
                    $\sin(180^{\deg}-\theta) = \sin(\theta)$, we will arrive at the same transformed basis vectors. A similar approach
                    can be used for reflex angles $\theta$, then utilising the fact that angles that are equal modulo $360^{\deg}$
                    produce equivalent rotations, we can claim that the above results apply to any angle $\theta$.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For a general vector $\boldsymbol{v}$, the definition of the standard basis vectors gives us that
                    $$
                        \boldsymbol{v} \> = \> \begin{pmatrix} v_x \\ v_y \\ v_y \end{pmatrix}
                        \> = \> v_x \boldsymbol{i} + v_y \boldsymbol{j} + v_z \boldsymbol{k}
                    $$
                    (i.e. $\boldsymbol{v}$ is a linear combination of the standard basis vectors, with coefficients equal to its
                    entries), and hence the rotation of $\boldsymbol{v}$ about the $z$-axis by angle $\theta$ is
                    $$
                    \boldsymbol{v}^{\prime} \> = \> v_x \boldsymbol{i}^{\prime} + v_y \boldsymbol{j}^{\prime} + v_z \boldsymbol{k}^{\prime}
                    \> = \> \begin{pmatrix} \cos(\theta)v_x - \sin(\theta)v_y \\ \sin(\theta)v_x + \cos(\theta)v_y \\ v_z \end{pmatrix}
                    $$
                    because affine transformations (of which a rotation is an example) preserve linear combinations of vectors.
                    Finally, returning to 3D homogeneous coordinates, we can equate this transformation to multiplication by the
                    matrix
                    $$\begin{pmatrix}

                        \sin \theta & \cos \theta & 0 & 0 \\
                        0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\
                        0 & 0 & 0 & 1
                    \end{pmatrix}.$$
                    An equivalent derivation can be performed for a rotation about the $x$-axis by an angle $\theta$ to find that its
                    matrix is
                    $$\begin{pmatrix}
                        1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
                        0 & \cos \theta & -\sin \theta & 0 \\
                        0 & \sin \theta & \cos \theta & 0 \\
                        0 & 0 & 0 & 1
                    \end{pmatrix},$$
                    and similarly, a rotation about the $y$-axis by $\theta$ is represented by the matrix
                    $$\begin{pmatrix}
                        \cos \theta & 0 & \sin \theta & 0 \\
                        0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
                        -\sin \theta & 0 & \cos \theta & 0 \\
                        0 & 0 & 0 & 1
                    \end{pmatrix}.$$
                    We won't derive this nor use it in our implementation, but for the sake of completeness, a rotation about an
                    arbitrary unit vector axis $(r_X,r_Y,r_Z)$ by an angle $\theta$ is represented by the matrix
                    $$
                    \begin{pmatrix}
                        \cos \theta + r_X^2 (1 - \cos \theta) & r_X r_Y (1 - \cos \theta) - r_Z \sin \theta & r_X r_Z (1 - \cos \theta) + r_Y \sin \theta & 0 \\
                        r_Y r_X (1 - \cos \theta) + r_Z \sin \theta & \cos \theta + r_Y^2 (1 - \cos \theta) & r_Y r_Z (1 - \cos \theta) - r_X \sin \theta & 0 \\
                        r_Z r_X (1 - \cos \theta) - r_Y \sin \theta & r_Z r_Y (1 - \cos \theta) + r_X \sin \theta & \cos \theta + r_Z^2 (1 - \cos \theta) & 0 \\
                        0 & 0 & 0 & 1
                    \end{pmatrix},
                    $$
                    which, as mentioned already, can also be achieved by a product of the three basis vector rotations (but this
                    approach can sometimes lead to numerical instability, so many advanced programs using vector rotations prefer
                    to use a direct rotation like this). Given angles of rotation about the $x$, $y$ and $z$ axes, we can write a
                    Python function which returns the resulting rotation matrix product.

                <h3>Model Transformation</h3>
                <p>
                    The model transformation in the vertex shader transforms a vertex's local coordinates to world
                    coordinates, using the position, orientation and scale of the object that the vertex belongs to. Hence,
                    the model transformation matrix is the product of a scale, rotation and translation matrix (in that
                    order, as scaling after translating would also scale the translation). We can use the functions we
                    wrote in the previous section to construct this matrix in Python.

                <h3>View Transformation</h3>
                <p>
                    The view transformation in the vertex shader transforms a vertex's world coordinates to view
                    coordinates, using the position and orientation of the camera in the world, in order to render
                    the world from the camera's perspective. Hence, the view transformation matrix is the product
                    of a translation and rotation matrix (in that order, as the rotation axis should stem from the
                    camera's position). Constructing the view matrix in Python is even simpler than the model matrix.

                <h3>Projection Transformation</h3>
                <p>
                    The perspective projection transformation defines a "rectangular frustum" volume in camera space which is
                    indirectly transformed to the $[-1,+1]$ cube in NDC/viewport space. This frustum is a sideways pyramid with
                    a rectangle for a base and its apex cut off (with the base facing away from the camera and the clipped apex
                    pointing towards the camera). We say "indirectly", because this matrix actually transforms from camera space
                    to "clip space" (which still uses 3D homogeneous coordinates), which is a precursor to NDC space. After the
                    vertex shader, OpenGL efficiently performs the perspective divide to convert clip space coordinates to NDC,
                    which completes the transformation from the frustum to the cube.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The inputs defining this transformation are:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            the vertical field of view $\theta_y$ which is the angle from the bottom to the top of the view from the
                            camera's origin (equivalently, the angle from the bottom to the top of the frustum from the apex);
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            the aspect ratio $A$ which is the screen width in pixels divided by the screen height in pixels,
                            which is used to derive the horizontal field of view (typical aspect ratios are 16:9 or 4:3);
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            the distance $Z_{\text{near}}$ along the $z$-axis from the camera's origin to the near clipping
                            plane (the close rectangle of the frustum where the apex is cut off) (note this parameter is positive
                            because it is a distance, despite the clipping planes having negative $z$-coordinates in camera space);
                            and
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            the distance $Z_{\text{far}}$ along the $z$-axis from the camera's origin to the far clipping plane
                            (the base of the frustum).
                        </li>

                <p>
                    TODO: DIAGRAM OF FRUSTUM HERE SIDE-VIEW HERE!
                </p>
                <p>
                    To derive the perspective projection matrix, let's forget about clip space for a moment and instead consider
                    the whole transformation from camera space to NDC (i.e., from the frustum to the $[-1,1]$ cube). We will
                    denote camera space coordinates by $x_{\text{cam}}$, $y_{\text{cam}}$ and $z_{\text{cam}}$, and NDC coordinates
                    by $x_{\text{NDC}}$, $y_{\text{NDC}}$ and $z_{\text{NDC}}$.
                </p>
                <p> 
                    Given some $z_{\text{cam}}$ \in $[-Z_{\text{far}}, -Z_{\text{near}}]$ inside the frustum, we can draw a right-
                    angled triangle on the $zy$-plane between the points $(0,0,0)$, $(0,0,z_{\text{cam}})$ and
                    $(0,y_{\text{bdy}},z_{\text{cam}})$, where $y_{\text{bdy}}$ is the half-height of the frustum at this
                    $z$-coordinate (so the third point lies on the top trapezium face of the frustum). The angle inside this triangle
                    at the origin is $\frac{\theta_y}{2}$, and hence we can claim that
                    $$\begin{aligned}
                        \tan\left(\frac{\theta_y}{2}\right) \> &= \> \frac{y_{\text{bdy}}}{-z_{\text{cam}}} \\
                        \Rightarrow \> y_{\text{bdy}} \> &= \> \tan\left(\frac{\theta_y}{2}\right) \cdot -z_{\text{cam}} \\
                        &= \> \frac{-z_{\text{cam}}}{F_y},
                    \end{aligned}$$
                    by defining the constant factor
                    $$F_y \> = \> \frac{1}{\tan\left(\frac{\theta_y}{2}\right)}.$$
                    We have derived an expression for $y_{\text{bdy}}$, which is the half-height of the frustum at any $z_{\text{cam}}$
                    inside the volume. At this $z$-coordinate, the perspective projection will linearly transform
                    $y_{\text{cam}} \in [-y_{\text{bdy}},y_{\text{bdy}}]$ to $y_{\text{NDC}} \in [-1,1]$, and hence
                    $$\begin{aligned}
                        y_{\text{NDC}} &= \frac{y_{\text{cam}}}{y_{\text{bdy}}} \\
                        &= \> y_{\text{cam}} \cdot \frac{F_y}{-z_{\text{cam}}}.
                    \end{aligned}$$
                    We can apply the exact same logic to derive an expression for $x_{\text{NDC}}$, using a modified factor
                    $$F_x \> = \> \frac{F_y}{A},$$
                    where dividing by the aspect ratio accounts for the different width of the frustum along the x-axis, and so
                    $$x_{\text{NDC}} \> = \> x_{\text{cam}} \cdot \frac{F_y}{A \cdot -z_{\text{cam}}}.$$
                    The inclusion of $-z_{\text{cam}}$ on the denominator of this transformation is what causes objects further from
                    the camera to appear smaller on the screen, which is a defining quality of the perspective projection over the
                    orthographic projection.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now it is left to transform $z_{\text{cam}}$ \in $[-Z_{\text{far}}, -Z_{\text{near}}]$ to
                    $z_{\text{NDC}}$ \in $[-1, 1]$. The standard approach is to use a reciprocal function such that objects further
                    from the camera appear smaller in depth, and it also ensures that $z$-coordinates closer to the camera consume a
                    disproportionately large part of the depth buffer (because objects close to the camera will be focused on more by
                    the viewer, and hence numerical imprecision causing objects that should have slightly different $z$-coordinates to
                    instead overlap would be more problematic if seen up close). Therefore, we establish that
                    $$z_{\text{NDC}} \> = \> \frac{\alpha}{z_{\text{cam}}} + \beta$$
                    for some constants $\alpha$ and $\beta$. We know that $z_{\text{cam}} = -Z_{\text{near}}$ is transformed to the
                    close face of the cube $z_{\text{NDC}} = -1$, and substituting this gives
                    $$\begin{aligned}
                        -1 \> &= \frac{\alpha}{-Z_{\text{near}}} + \beta \\
                        \Rightarrow \> -1 - \beta \> &= \frac{\alpha}{-Z_{\text{near}}} \\
                        \Rightarrow \> \alpha \> &= (-1 - \beta) \cdot -Z_{\text{near}}.
                    \end{aligned}$$
                    Similarly, we know that $z_{\text{cam}} = -Z_{\text{far}}$ is transformed to the far face of the cube
                    $z_{\text{NDC}} = 1$, and so
                    $$\begin{aligned}
                        1 \> &= \frac{\alpha}{-Z_{\text{far}}} + \beta \\
                        \Rightarrow \> 1 - \beta \> &= \frac{\alpha}{-Z_{\text{far}}} \\
                        \Rightarrow \> \alpha \> &= (1 - \beta) \cdot -Z_{\text{far}}.
                    \end{aligned}$$
                    Equating these two expressions for $\alpha$ gives
                    $$\begin{aligned}
                        (-1 - \beta) \cdot -Z_{\text{near}} \> &= \> (1 - \beta) \cdot -Z_{\text{far}} \\
                        \Rightarrow \> Z_{\text{near}} + \beta Z_{\text{near}} \> &= \> -Z_{\text{far}} + \beta Z_{\text{far}} \\
                        \Rightarrow \> \beta Z_{\text{near}} - \beta Z_{\text{far}} \> &= \> -Z_{\text{far}} - Z_{\text{near}} \\
                        \Rightarrow \> \beta \> &= \> -\frac{Z_{\text{far}} + Z_{\text{near}}}{Z_{\text{near}} - Z_{\text{far}}},
                    \end{aligned}$$
                    which is the constant value of $\beta$. Substituting this back into the second expression for $\alpha$ gives
                    $$\begin{aligned}

                    Finally, substituting these constants back into our formula for $z_{\text{NDC}}$ gives

                            + \frac{2 Z_{\text{near}} Z_{\text{far}}}{Z_{\text{near}} - Z_{\text{far}}}

                <p>
                    We have now derived equations for $x_{\text{NDC}}$, $y_{\text{NDC}}$ and $z_{\text{NDC}}$ in terms of
                    $x_{\text{cam}}$, $y_{\text{cam}}$ and $z_{\text{cam}}$, but notice that these form a non-linear transformation
                    from camera space to NDC/viewport space due to the common divisor of $-z_{\text{cam}}$ in the formulae. This is
                    where the purpose of the intermediate "clip space" becomes evident. As previously defined, NDC are computed from
                    clip space coordinates using the perspective divide operation (which OpenGL performs very efficiently for us):
                    $$
                        x_{\text{NDC}} = \frac{x_{\text{clip}}}{w_{\text{clip}}}, \>
                        y_{\text{NDC}} = \frac{y_{\text{clip}}}{w_{\text{clip}}}, \>
                        z_{\text{NDC}} = \frac{z_{\text{clip}}}{w_{\text{clip}}}.
                    $$
                    If we define $w_{\text{clip}} = -z_{\text{cam}}$, then the NDC equations we derived give us
                    $$\begin{aligned}
                        x_{\text{clip}} \> &= \> \frac{F_y}{A} \cdot x_{\text{cam}}, \\
                        y_{\text{clip}} \> &= \> F_y \cdot y_{\text{cam}}, \\
                        z_{\text{clip}} \> &= \> \frac{Z_{\text{far}} + Z_{\text{near}}}{Z_{\text{near}} - Z_{\text{far}}} \cdot
                        z_{\text{cam}} + \frac{2 Z_{\text{near}} Z_{\text{far}}}{Z_{\text{near}} - Z_{\text{far}}},
                    \end{aligned}$$
                    all of which are linear equations of the camera coordinates. Therefore, we can define the perspective projection
                    transformation from camera space to clip space as multiplication by the matrix
                    $$
                    \begin{pmatrix}
                        \frac{F_y}{A} & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
                        0 & F_y & 0 & 0 \\
                        0 & 0 & \frac{Z_{\text{far}} + Z_{\text{near}}}{Z_{\text{near}} - Z_{\text{far}}} &
                        \frac{2 Z_{\text{near}} Z_{\text{far}}}{Z_{\text{near}} - Z_{\text{far}}} \\
                        0 & 0 & -1 & 0
                    \end{pmatrix}.
                    Finally, we can implement a simple Python function that returns this matrix given the field of view, aspect ratio,
                    and the near and far clipping planes.

                <h3>PyOpenGL Implementation</h3>
                <p>
                    We will now put our understanding of OpenGL and the mathematics of matrix transformations to use by implementing a Python program which renders
                    a rotating, textured cube. We will start by implementing a series of PyOpenGL utility functions (to handle core procedures such as initialising
                    a window, compiling shaders, loading textures and sending data to the GPU), as well as defining our vertex and fragment shaders. We will then
                    use these functions to write a succinct main program for rendering the rotating cube.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The first utility function we need to define is one that initialises a window for us to render in. We will use
                    <a href="https://github.com/FlorianRhiem/pyGLFW", target="_blank">pyGLFW</a>, which is a Python binding to
                    <a href="https://www.glfw.org/", target="_blank">GLFW</a>, an OpenGL utility library that provides a simple API for managing windows and handling
                    input. This function receives the window's title, width and height (in pixels) as input, initialises GLFW, creates a window (which also creates
                    its OpenGL context, which is then made current), sets a callback function to handle window resizing, then returns the window object for later use.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Before we continue with PyOpenGL, we need to define our vertex and fragment shaders. We write our shaders in GLSL (the OpenGL Shading Language),
                    which is very similar to C but notably provides vector and matrix types tailored for graphics programming. The vertex shader is written as
                    follows:
                    <ul>
                        <li>the first line defines the version of GLSL we are using;</li>
                        <li>
                            next, we define the attributes of an input vertex that this shader will process (in our case, an input vertex has a position attribute
                            with three values, as our vertices are three dimensional, and a texture coordinate attribute with two values, because our texture is two
                            dimensional);
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            following this, we define the vertex shader's output variables (in addition to the default output vector `gl_Position`), which in our case
                            is a 2D texture coordinate vector we wish to forward to the fragment shader;
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            then we define uniforms, which are global variables (per shader program) which are set by the application (running on the CPU) and can be
                            accessed by any shader (running on the GPU), and these only change when the application explicitly sets them; and
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            finally we define the main function of the shader (where we can use our inputs and uniforms), where the first line multiplies the model,
                            view and projection matrices by the input vertex (after it is converted to homogeneous coordinates) and assigns this output clip space
                            vector to the pre-defined `gl_Position` variable, and the second line simply assigns the input texture coordinate to the output texture
                            coordinate.
                        </li>

                    We save the above vertex shader code to a file called `vertex_shader.vs`. We also define our fragment shader and save it to a file called
                    `fragment_shader.fs`, and this shader is written as follows:
                    <ul>
                        <li>the first line defines the version of GLSL we are using;</li>
                        <li>
                            next, we define the single input variable of this shader with the same type and name as the additional output of the vertex shader,
                            such that when the shader program is linked, OpenGL will link these variables together (so at runtime this input will hold the texture
                            coordinate we forwarded from the vertex shader);
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            following this, we define a single output variable, which is a 4D vector holding the RGBA colour of the fragment (the name of this
                            variable doesn't matter, as OpenGL automatically forwards the singular `vec4` output of our fragment shader down the pipeline);
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            next we define a uniform variable, which is a `sampler2D` type which provides the fragment shader access to a 2D texture (we will
                            set this uniform to our texture object in the application code); and
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            finally we define the main function of the shader, where we use GLSL's built-in `texture` function to sample the texture at the
                            input texture coordinate, and assign the resulting colour to the shader's output colour variable.
                        </li>

                    Now that we have defined our shaders, we can implement a utility function which loads a shader's source code from file, creates an OpenGL "shader
                    object" for it, attaches the source code and compiles it, then returns the shader object's ID. This function also checks for compilation errors,
                    such that this utility function successfully returning implies that the shader's source code is valid. The arguments to this function are simply
                    the file path of the shader's source code and the type of shader (either "vertex" or "fragment").

                    We now look to implement a utility function that loads the vertex data for a unit cube, which comprises five floating point numbers per vertex:
                    the $x$, $y$ and $z$ coordinates of the vertex in model space, and the 2D texture coordinates $s$ and $t$. Given a 2D texture, the bottom-left
                    corner has coordinates $(s,t) = (0,0)$ and the top-right corner has coordinates $(1,1)$. Specifying the texture coordinates for each vertex of
                    the cube defines precisely how the texture is to be mapped onto the cube's faces, as each fragment's texture coordinate is interpolated from
                    the vertex texture coordinates of the primitive (in our case, a triangle) it belongs to. The fragment shader performs the task of sampling from
                    the texture at these interpolated coordinates to determine the fragment's colour.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This function begins by defining the vertices of the unit cube as a 1D GLM floating point array, where each square face is defined by two
                    triangle primitives. Next, we create a vertex array object (VAO, which stores vertex attribute configurations) and a vertex buffer object (VBO,
                    which stores vertex data such that it can be sent to the GPU all at once instead of one vertex at a time). We bind the VAO and VBO to the
                    current OpenGL context, then load the vertex data into the VBO by specifying: which bound buffer to load data into, the size of the data in
                    bytes, a pointer to the data, and a GPU usage hint (in this case, `GL_STATIC_DRAW` indicates that the data will not be modified frequently).
                    Finally, we call the `glVertexAttribPointer` function (per vertex attribute) to specify the layout of the vertex data in the VBO:
                    <ul>
                        <li>the first argument is the index/position of the attribute we are configuring;</li>
                        <li>next is the size of the attribute in values;</li>
                        <li>then we specify the type of the attribute's values;</li>
                        <li>the fourth argument is a boolean indicating if the values should be normalised (not relevant in our case);</li>
                        <li>the fifth argument is the stride between consecutive vertices (in bytes, which equals the total size of each vertex's data); and</li>
                        <li>the final argument is an offset from the start of each vertex's data to the start of this attribute's data.</li>
                    </ul>
                    Following each call to this function, we call `glEnableVertexAttribArray` to enable the attribute (all vertex attributes are disabled by default).
                    Finally, our utility function returns the VAO and VBO IDs and the number of vertices comprising the cube.

                    Next up, we need a utility function for loading a texture from an image file. This function receives the file path of the texture image as input and:
                    <ul>
                        <li>checks the file path is valid;</li>
                        <li>creates a texture object and binds it to the OpenGL context, which makes it the currently active 2D texture for manipulation;</li>
                        <li>
                            sets the texture wrapping method for the `S` (horizontal) and `T` (vertical) axes to `GL_REPEAT` (so texture coordinates outside the
                            $[0,1]$ range will be handled by repeating the texture image like a tile);
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            sets the texture filtering method for minifying (scaling down) to `GL_LINEAR_MIPMAP_LINEAR` (a linear interpolation of the two nearest
                            mipmap levels, with linear interpolation between the four nearest texels in each mipmap level), and for magnifying (scaling up) to
                            `GL_LINEAR` (a linear interpolation of the four nearest texels);
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            loads the image file using the <a href="https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/", target="_blank">Python Imaging Library (PIL)</a> and
                            flips it vertically (as OpenGL expects the origin to be the bottom-left, whilst PIL uses the top-left);
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            sends the image data to the texture object (specifying the currently bound 2D texture, the base mipmap level 0, the intended texture
                            format as RGB, the image width and height, a legacy border size which must always be 0, the source format as RGB and source data type
                            as unsigned bytes, and finally the image data itself);
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            generates mipmaps for the texture object (a sequence of 50% downscaled copies of the original image used when the texture is sampled onto
                            a small or distant surface to prevent wasted processing or aliasing artifacts); and finally
                        </li>

                    We have yet to handle sending uniform data to the GPU to be used by our vertex and fragment shaders. This next utility function handles sending
                    a 4x4 matrix to the GPU, which we will use to send our model, view and projection matrices. This function takes as input the shader program ID,
                    the name of the uniform variable (as defined in the shader code) and the matrix as a Numpy array. We first check that the matrix is 4x4, then
                    query OpenGL for the location of the uniform variable in the shader program, before assigning the matrix data to the uniform variable using
                    the `glUniformMatrix4fv` function (which takes the uniform location, the number of matrices to send, a boolean indicating if the matrix should
                    be transposed, and a pointer to the matrix data). If the uniform was not found, this function raises an exception.

                    Next up, we define a utility function that sets the "texture unit" of each sampler uniform in the shader program. Texture units allow us to
                    use multiple textures in a shader program (even though in this application, we only use one), by assigning each sampler uniform a unique
                    texture unit that we activate before binding a texture to it. This function takes the shader program ID and an ordered list of sampler uniform
                    names as input. It calls `glUseProgram` to activate our shader program, then iterates through each uniform name, querying OpenGL for the
                    location of the uniform in the shader program and assigning the next free texture unit (starting with 0) to it.

                    `glBindTexture` with the corresponding texture object ID, which binds that texture object to the texture unit, which will allow the fragment
                    shader to sample the texture from that texture unit's uniform sampler.

                    In this tutorial we will handle only a single user input: the escape key. To do this, we define a `process_input` function which is called at
                    the beginning of the main loop. We use pyGLFW's `get_key` function to check if the escape key is currently being pressed, and if it is, we
                    set GLFW's `window_should_close` flag to `True`, which will cause the main loop to exit before the next iteration.
