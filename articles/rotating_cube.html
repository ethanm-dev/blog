                <h3>Context</h3>
                <p>
                    OpenGL is a popular graphics programming specification that is supported by most GPUs used today. OpenGL
                    is implemented via graphics drivers that are typically written in C and provided by the GPU manufacturer,
                    along with client and API libraries, typically written in assembly, C or C++, the latter of which a
                    programmer can use to interact with the GPU. PyOpenGL is a Python binding to the OpenGL API, which is
                    implemented with Python's ctypes foreign function interface and bridges the gap between Python and the
                    lower-level API library, providing a close replica of the OpenGL API in Python.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This article provides a basic overview of the OpenGL API, before detailing the mathematical
                    transformations required to render a 3D cube in a 2D display. This theory is demonstrated via an
                    implementation of the classic rotating cube exercise in PyOpenGL, without relying on GLM, which is OpenGL's
                    mathematics library. This library abstracts the underlying maths by providing a set of functions for
                    constructing transformation matrices, but we will instead implement these transformations ourselves.
                </p>

                <h3>OpenGL Overview</h3>
                <p>
                    The OpenGL API operates like a state machine which we can interact with in one of two ways: by calling
                    a function which changes the state (e.g., linking a new shader program) or by calling a function which
                    performs an action using the current state (e.g., drawing a shape to the screen). This state is called
                    the OpenGL context and is organised like a C struct, where different sub-components (called objects) can
                    be swapped in and out (called binding and unbinding respectively). 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The transformation of 3D objects in memory to 2D pixels on a screen is performed by OpenGL's graphics
                    pipeline, comprised of a sequence of programs called shaders which run on the GPU and are written
                    in GLSL (the openGL Shading Language). Modern GPUs have hundreds or even thousands of cores, each capable
                    of running a shader in parallel, which is why GPUs are so much faster than CPUs for graphics processing
                    (modern CPUs typically have 4-8 far more generalised cores).
                </p>
                <p>
                    The first stage of the graphics pipeline is the vertex shader, for which there is no default (we must
                    provide our own implementation of this step). This shader receives a single vertex as input, whose 3D
                    coordinates $(x,y,z)$ are in "local space", meaning they are relative to the origin of the object the
                    vertex belongs to. This shader is responsible for converting these local coordinates into 3D homogeneous
                    "clip space" coordinates $(x_C, y_C, z_C, w_C)$, which are then used to determine which parts of objects
                    are visible on the screen. The vertex shader also forwards any other data associated with the vertex
                    for use in later stages of the pipeline (such as 2D texture coordinates). The vertex shader achieves
                    the local to clip space conversion by applying a sequence of transformations:
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            the model transformation converts local coordinates to world coordinates, using information
                            about the object's position, orientation and size in the world we are rendering, and hence
                            is the combination of a scale, translation and rotation transformation;
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            the view transformation converts world coordinates to view/camera coordinates, using information
                            about the position and orientation of the camera in the world, and hence is the combination of a
                            translation and rotation transformation; and
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            the projection transformation converts view coordinates to clip coordinates (NDC), using
                            information about the camera's type (orthographic or perspective), field of view and range.
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Following the vertex shader in the graphics pipeline (ignoring some advanced, optional steps) is the primitive
                    assembly stage, where a set of processed vertices are grouped into a sequence of primitives (points, lines or
                    triangles, depending on the context). Next is the clipping stage, where primitives lying outside the viewing
                    volume (defined by $-w_C \le x_C \le w_C$ and likewise for $y_C$ and $z_C$) are discarded, and primitives
                    only partially inside the volume are clipped to fit within it (a triangle may be split into multiple triangles
                    here). Next is the perspective divide
                    $$(x_{\text{NDC}}, y_{\text{NDC}}, z_{\text{NDC}}) \> = \> (\frac{x_C}{w_C}, \frac{y_C}{w_C}, \frac{z_C}{w_C})$$
                    into normalised device coordinates where $|x_{\text{NDC}}| \le 1$, $|y_{\text{NDC}}| \le 1$ and
                    $|z_{\text{NDC}}| \le 1$. After this is the viewport transformation, which converts NDC to window coordinates,
                    which depends on the window size in pixels and the size of the device's depth buffer. Next is face culling,
                    where triangle primitives facing away from view in window space can be discarded, such that they don't need
                    to be rendered.
