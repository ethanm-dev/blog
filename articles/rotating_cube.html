                <h3>Context</h3>
                <p>
                    OpenGL is a popular graphics programming specification that is supported by most GPUs used today. OpenGL
                    is implemented via graphics drivers that are typically written in C and provided by the GPU manufacturer,
                    along with client and API libraries, typically written in assembly, C or C++, the latter of which a
                    programmer can use to interact with the GPU. PyOpenGL is a Python binding to the OpenGL API, which is
                    implemented with Python's ctypes foreign function interface and bridges the gap between Python and the
                    lower-level API library, providing a close replica of the OpenGL API in Python.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This article provides a basic overview of the OpenGL API, before detailing the mathematical
                    transformations required to render a 3D cube in a 2D display. This theory is demonstrated via an
                    implementation of the classic rotating cube exercise in PyOpenGL, without relying on GLM, which is OpenGL's
                    mathematics library. This library abstracts the underlying maths by providing a set of functions for
                    constructing transformation matrices, but we will instead implement these transformations ourselves.
                </p>

                <h3>OpenGL Overview</h3>
                <p>
                    The OpenGL API operates like a state machine which we can interact with in one of two ways: by calling
                    a function which changes the state (e.g., linking a new shader program) or by calling a function which
                    performs an action using the current state (e.g., drawing a shape to the screen). This state is called
                    the OpenGL context and is organised like a C struct, where different sub-components (called objects) can
                    be swapped in and out (called binding and unbinding respectively). 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The transformation of 3D objects in memory to 2D pixels on a screen is performed by OpenGL's graphics
                    pipeline, comprised of a sequence of programs called shaders which run on the GPU and are written
                    in GLSL (the openGL Shading Language). Modern GPUs have hundreds or even thousands of cores, each capable
                    of running a shader in parallel, which is why GPUs are so much faster than CPUs for graphics processing
                    (modern CPUs typically have 4-8 far more generalised cores). The graphics pipeline is as follows:
                    <ol>
                        <li>vertex shader - TODO (can define our own);</li>
                        <li>geometry shader - TODO (can define our own);</li>
                        <li>shape assembly - TODO;</li>
                        <li>rasterisation - TODO;</li>
                        <li>fragment shader - TODO (can define our own); and</li>
                        <li>tests & blending - TODO.</li>
                    </ol>
                </p>
