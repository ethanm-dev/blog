                <h3>Context</h3>
                <p>
                    OpenGL is a popular graphics programming specification that is supported by most GPUs used today. OpenGL
                    is implemented via graphics drivers that are typically written in C and provided by the GPU manufacturer,
                    along with client and API libraries, typically written in assembly, C or C++, the latter of which a
                    programmer can use to interact with the GPU. PyOpenGL is a Python binding to the OpenGL API, which is
                    implemented with Python's ctypes foreign function interface and bridges the gap between Python and the
                    lower-level API library, providing a close replica of the OpenGL API in Python.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This article provides a basic overview of the OpenGL API, before detailing the mathematical
                    transformations required to render a 3D cube in a 2D display. This theory is demonstrated via an
                    implementation of the classic rotating cube exercise in PyOpenGL, without relying on GLM, which is OpenGL's
                    mathematics library. This library abstracts the underlying maths by providing a set of functions for
                    constructing transformation matrices, but we will instead implement these transformations ourselves.
                </p>

                <h3>OpenGL Overview</h3>
                <p>
                    The OpenGL API operates like a state machine which we can interact with in one of two ways: by calling
                    a function which changes the state (e.g., linking a new shader program) or by calling a function which
                    performs an action using the current state (e.g., drawing a shape to the screen). This state is called
                    the OpenGL context and is organised like a C struct, where different sub-components (called objects) can
                    be swapped in and out (called binding and unbinding respectively). 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The transformation of 3D objects in memory to 2D pixels on a screen is performed by OpenGL's graphics
                    pipeline, comprised of a sequence of programs called shaders which run on the GPU and are written
                    in GLSL (the openGL Shading Language). Modern GPUs have hundreds or even thousands of cores, each capable
                    of running a shader in parallel, which is why GPUs are so much faster than CPUs for graphics processing
                    (modern CPUs typically have 4-8 far more generalised cores).
                </p>
                <p>
                    The first stage of the graphics pipeline is the vertex shader, for which there is no default (we must
                    provide our own implementation of this step). This shader receives a single vertex as input, whose 3D
                    coordinates $(x,y,z)$ are in "local space", meaning they are relative to the origin of the object the
                    vertex belongs to. This shader is responsible for converting these local coordinates into 3D homogeneous
                    "clip space" coordinates $(x_C, y_C, z_C, w_C)$, which are then used to determine which parts of objects
                    are visible on the screen. The vertex shader also forwards any other data associated with the vertex
                    for use in later stages of the pipeline (such as 2D texture coordinates). The vertex shader achieves
                    the local to clip space conversion by applying a sequence of transformations:
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            the model transformation converts local coordinates to world coordinates, using information
                            about the object's position, orientation and size in the world we are rendering, and hence
                            is the combination of a scale, translation and rotation transformation;
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            the view transformation converts world coordinates to view/camera coordinates, using information
                            about the position and orientation of the camera in the world, and hence is the combination of a
                            translation and rotation transformation; and
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            the projection transformation converts view coordinates to clip coordinates (NDC), using
                            information about the camera's type (orthographic or perspective), field of view and range.
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Following the vertex shader in the graphics pipeline (ignoring some advanced, optional steps) is the primitive
                    assembly stage, where a set of processed vertices are grouped into a sequence of primitives (points, lines or
                    triangles, depending on the context). Next is the clipping stage, where primitives lying outside the viewing
                    volume (defined by $-w_C \le x_C \le w_C$ and likewise for $y_C$ and $z_C$) are discarded, and primitives
                    only partially inside the volume are clipped to fit within it (a triangle may be split into multiple triangles
                    here). Next is the perspective divide
                    $$(x_{\text{NDC}}, y_{\text{NDC}}, z_{\text{NDC}}) \> = \> (\frac{x_C}{w_C}, \frac{y_C}{w_C}, \frac{z_C}{w_C})$$
                    into normalised device coordinates where $|x_{\text{NDC}}| \le 1$, $|y_{\text{NDC}}| \le 1$ and
                    $|z_{\text{NDC}}| \le 1$. After this is the viewport transformation, which converts NDC to window coordinates,
                    which depends on the window size in pixels and the size of the device's depth buffer. Next is face culling,
                    where triangle primitives facing away from view in window space can be discarded, such that they don't need
                    to be rendered. Then the pipeline performs rasterisation, where each primitive is mapped to a set fragments,
                    with at least one fragment per pixel displaying the primitive. A fragment is a collection of all data required
                    to render a single pixel (which includes data that was forwarded from the vertex shader).
                </p>
                <p>
                    The next stage is the fragment shader, which, like the vertex shader, has no default implementation. This shader
                    receives a single fragment as input and returns a colour to be drawn to the screen at its corresponding pixel
                    (as well as some other data including depth). The final stage of the graphics pipeline is a sequence of
                    "per-sample" operations on each fragment, which include pixel ownership testing (which fails if the fragment's
                    pixel location is owned by another overlapping window), depth testing (checking if this fragment is behind
                    another fragment and should be discarded) and blending (combining the fragment's colour with a colour already
                    in the frame buffer for this pixel, to handle opacity).
                </p>

                <h3>Transformation Matrices</h3>
                <p>
                    Before we start programming with PyOpenGL, we first need to define the model, view and projection
                    transformations required to implement our vertex shader. Given a vertex with coordinates $(x,y,z)$, we
                    represent this point in space by the vector of homogeneous coordinates
                    $$\begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \\ z \\ 1 \end{pmatrix},$$
                    where the fourth coordinate will remain 1 until the projection transformation. Given this definition, we can
                    represent a transformation of this point by a 4x4 matrix that is left-multiplied by the vector. An affine
                    transformation such as a scaling, translation or rotation can be achieved with a matrix multiplication of
                    the form
                    $$
                    \begin{pmatrix}
                        m_{11} & m_{12} & m_{13} & 0 \\
                        m_{21} & m_{22} & m_{23} & 0 \\
                        m_{31} & m_{32} & m_{33} & 0 \\
                        0 & 0 & 0 & 1
                    \end{pmatrix}
                    \begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \\ z \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} \> = \>
                    \begin{pmatrix}
                        m_{11} x + m_{12} y + m_{13} z \\
                        m_{21} x + m_{22} y + m_{23} z \\
                        m_{31} x + m_{32} y + m_{33} z \\
                        1
                    \end{pmatrix},
                    $$
                    and hence combining transformations is equivalent to multiplying their representative matrices.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A scale transformation with scaling factors $s_X, s_Y$ and $s_Z$ converts a point $(x,y,z,1)$ to the
                    point $(s_X x, s_Y y, s_Z z, 1)$, which is achieved by multiplying by the diagonal matrix
                    $$\begin{pmatrix} s_X & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & s_Y & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & s_Z & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix}.$$
                    We can write a Python function which returns this matrix as a 2D NumPy array given a set of scaling factors.

                    A translation transformation which translates by distance $t_X$ in the $x$-direction, $t_Y$ in the
                    $y$-direction and $t_Z$ in the $z$-direction, thus converting a point $(x,y,z,1)$ to the point
                    $(x + t_X, y + t_Y, z + t_Z, 1)$, is achieved by the matrix:
                    $$\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 & t_X \\ 0 & 1 & 0 & t_Y \\ 0 & 0 & 1 & t_Z \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix}.$$
                    This transformation can also be implemented as a simple Python function.

                    A rotation in 3D space is defined by a (unit vector) axis and an angle of rotation about that axis.
                    A rotation about the $x$-axis by angle $\theta$ is represented by:
                    $$\begin{pmatrix}
                        1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
                        0 & \cos \theta & -\sin \theta & 0 \\
                        0 & \sin \theta & \cos \theta & 0 \\
                        0 & 0 & 0 & 1
                    \end{pmatrix},$$
                    a rotation about the $y$-axis by angle $\theta$ is represented by:
                    $$\begin{pmatrix}
                        \cos \theta & 0 & \sin \theta & 0 \\
                        0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
                        -\sin \theta & 0 & \cos \theta & 0 \\
                        0 & 0 & 0 & 1
                    \end{pmatrix},$$
                    and a rotation about the $z$-axis by angle $\theta$ is represented by:
                    $$\begin{pmatrix}
                        \cos \theta & -\sin \theta & 0 & 0 \\
                        \sin \theta & \cos \theta & 0 & 0 \\
                        0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\
                        0 & 0 & 0 & 1
                    \end{pmatrix}.$$
                    As an example, take the point $(x,y,z) = (1,1,0)$ and apply a rotation about the $z$-axis by 180
                    degrees (or $\pi$ radians):
                    $$
                    \begin{pmatrix}
                        \cos \pi & -\sin \pi & 0 & 0 \\
                        \sin \pi & \cos \pi & 0 & 0 \\
                        0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\
                        0 & 0 & 0 & 1
                    \end{pmatrix}
                    \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 1 \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} \> = \>
                    \begin{pmatrix}
                        -1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
                        0 & -1 & 0 & 0 \\
                        0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\
                        0 & 0 & 0 & 1
                    \end{pmatrix}
                    \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 1 \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} \> = \>
                    \begin{pmatrix} -1 \\ -1 \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}
                    $$
                    which is the expected result. A rotation about an arbitrary unit vector axis $(r_X,r_Y,r_Z)$ by angle
                    $\theta$ is represented by the matrix
                    $$
                    \begin{pmatrix}
                        \cos \theta + r_X^2 (1 - \cos \theta) & r_X r_Y (1 - \cos \theta) - r_Z \sin \theta & r_X r_Z (1 - \cos \theta) + r_Y \sin \theta & 0 \\
                        r_Y r_X (1 - \cos \theta) + r_Z \sin \theta & \cos \theta + r_Y^2 (1 - \cos \theta) & r_Y r_Z (1 - \cos \theta) - r_X \sin \theta & 0 \\
                        r_Z r_X (1 - \cos \theta) - r_Y \sin \theta & r_Z r_Y (1 - \cos \theta) + r_X \sin \theta & \cos \theta + r_Z^2 (1 - \cos \theta) & 0 \\
                        0 & 0 & 0 & 1
                    \end{pmatrix},
                    $$
                    which could also be achieved by a product of the three basis vector rotations (but such an approach can
                    lead to numerical instability, so this direct rotation should be preferred). We can write a flexible
                    Python function which will allow us to use either approach, saving some unnecessary computation if we
                    wish to rotate about a basis vector.

                <h3>Model Transformation</h3>
                <p>
                    The model transformation in the vertex shader transforms a vertex's local coordinates to world
                    coordinates, using the position, orientation and scale of the object that the vertex belongs to. Hence,
                    the model transformation matrix is the product of a scale, rotation and translation matrix (in that
                    order, as scaling after translating would also scale the translation). We can use the functions we
                    wrote in the previous section to construct this matrix in Python.
                </p>
                <pre><code class="language-python">def model_matrix(
    scale_x: float = 1.0,
    scale_y: float = 1.0,

    rot_axis_y: float = 0.0,
    rot_axis_z: float = 1.0,

    if trans_x != 0.0 or trans_y != 0.0 or trans_z != 0.0:

                <h3>View Transformation</h3>
                <p>
                    The view transformation in the vertex shader transforms a vertex's world coordinates to view
                    coordinates, using the position and orientation of the camera in the world, in order to render
                    the world from the camera's perspective. Hence, the view transformation matrix is the product
                    of a translation and rotation matrix (in that order, as the rotation axis should stem from the
                    camera's position). Constructing the view matrix in Python is even simpler than the model matrix.
                </p>
                <pre><code class="language-python">def view_matrix(
    camera_x: float = 0.0,

                    the projection transformation converts view coordinates to clip coordinates (NDC), using
                    information about the camera's type (orthographic or perspective), field of view and range
